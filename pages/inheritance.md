# Inheritance

**Inheritance** is one of the four pillars of OOP and models the **"Is-A"** relationship. It creates hierarchy where a specialized class (**Subclass**) is based on the general class (**Superclass**).

The key characteristics of Inheritance are:

1. **Code Reuse:** The subclass automatically receives the attributes and behaviors of the Superclass.
2. **Polymorphism Setup:** It allows objects of different classes (e.g., `Dog` and `Cat`) to be treated as a common type (`Animal`).
3. **Family Lineage:** The Subclass is a kind of the Superclass (a `Car` is a `Vehicle`).

However, inheritance is not the only way, or even the most common way, objects are related. If every object interaction used inheritance, our programs would be chaotic family trees. We need other, more flexible forms of relationship.
